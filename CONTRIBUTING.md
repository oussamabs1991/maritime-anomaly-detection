## 🎯 Code Standards

### Code Style

We use the following tools to maintain code quality:

- **Black** for code formatting (line length: 100)
- **isort** for import sorting
- **flake8** for linting
- **mypy** for type checking
- **pre-commit** for automated checks

### Code Quality Checklist

- [ ] Code follows PEP 8 style guidelines
- [ ] Functions and classes have docstrings
- [ ] Type hints are used where appropriate
- [ ] Error handling is implemented properly
- [ ] Code is DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
- [ ] Magic numbers are avoided (use constants)
- [ ] Security best practices are followed

### Python Code Guidelines

```python
def extract_vessel_features(trajectory: pd.DataFrame) -> Dict[str, float]:
    """
    Extract features from vessel trajectory data.
    
    Args:
        trajectory: DataFrame with vessel trajectory points
        
    Returns:
        Dictionary containing extracted features
        
    Raises:
        ValueError: If trajectory is empty or invalid
    """
    if trajectory.empty:
        raise ValueError("Trajectory cannot be empty")
    
    # Implementation here
    return features
```

## 🧪 Testing Guidelines

### Test Structure

```
tests/
├── test_config.py          # Configuration tests
├── test_data.py            # Data loading/preprocessing tests
├── test_features.py        # Feature extraction tests
├── test_models.py          # Model tests
├── test_utils.py           # Utility function tests
└── test_pipeline.py        # Integration tests
```

### Writing Tests

1. **Use descriptive test names**:
   ```python
   def test_kalman_filter_smooths_noisy_trajectory():
       """Test that Kalman filter reduces noise in trajectory data."""
   ```

2. **Follow AAA pattern** (Arrange, Act, Assert):
   ```python
   def test_feature_extraction_returns_correct_shape():
       # Arrange
       sample_data = create_sample_trajectory()
       extractor = FeatureExtractor()
       
       # Act
       features = extractor.extract_features(sample_data)
       
       # Assert
       assert features.shape == (1, 25)  # Expected feature count
   ```

3. **Use fixtures for common test data**:
   ```python
   @pytest.fixture
   def sample_ais_data():
       return pd.DataFrame({
           'MMSI': [123456789, 123456789],
           'LAT': [34.05, 34.06],
           'LON': [-118.25, -118.24],
           # ... more columns
       })
   ```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
make test

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/test_data.py -v

# Run with coverage
pytest tests/ --cov=src --cov-report=html

# Run performance tests
pytest tests/ -m "performance"
```

### Test Categories

Mark tests with appropriate categories:

```python
import pytest

@pytest.mark.unit
def test_data_loader_initialization():
    """Unit test for data loader."""
    pass

@pytest.mark.integration  
def test_complete_pipeline():
    """Integration test for full pipeline."""
    pass

@pytest.mark.performance
def test_model_training_time():
    """Performance test for model training."""
    pass
```

## 📚 Documentation

### Documentation Standards

- **Docstrings**: Use Google style docstrings for all public functions and classes
